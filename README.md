# Med-CORDEX Phase 3 internal data request

This repository collects the Med-CORDEX variables to be exchanged internally among the groups to carry out specific studies before the data is available on ESGF.
The data request is in the file [dreq_MED_internal.csv](https://github.com/Med-CORDEX/internal-data-request/blob/main/dreq_MED_internal.csv).
Modellers can use this file to automate the transfer to the server, when ready.

Study leads, please, [open an issue](https://github.com/Med-CORDEX/internal-data-request/issues) to explain briefly the variables required for your study (variable name and frequency) and the experiments (evaluation, historical, ssp126, ...).
The variables should be available the [full Med-CORDEX data request](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/data-request-table/blob/join-components/data-request/dreq_MED.csv).
